Overall Description\n\n#### 2.1 Product Perspective\nThe platform is a standalone application leveraging the Solana blockchain to manage educational and professional credentials securely. It eliminates reliance on centralized databases by storing credentials on a decentralized ledger, ensuring transparency and immutability. The system integrates with existing educational and certification systems, allowing issuers to publish credentials and verifiers to confirm their authenticity.\n\n#### 2.2 Product Functions\n- **Issuance**: Authorized issuers create and publish credentials on the blockchain.\n- **Storage**: Credentials are stored immutably on the Solana blockchain.\n- **Verification**: Verifiers query the blockchain to validate credentials.\n- **User Management**: Registration and profile management for issuers, verifiers, and credential owners.\n- **Search and Retrieval**: Credential owners can access their credentials.\n- **Revocation**: Issuers can revoke credentials if necessary.\n\n#### 2.3 User Characteristics\n| User Role | Description | Technical Proficiency |\n|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| **Issuers** | Educational institutions or certification bodies issuing credentials. | Moderate; requires training on platform features. |\n| **Verifiers** | Employers or institutions verifying credentials. | Basic; familiar with web applications. |\n| **Credential Owners** | Individuals who own diplomas or certificates. | Basic; familiar with online platforms. |\n| **Administrators** | Manage user access and system operations. | Advanced; technical expertise required. |\n\n#### 2.4 Constraints\n- Development must use Rust, Solana, Anchor, Cargo test framework, React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS.\n- The platform must operate on the Solana blockchain.\n- Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) is mandatory.\n- The system must support at least 1000 transactions per second.\n\n#### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies\n- Users have internet access and modern web browsers.\n- The Solana blockchain remains operational.\n- Issuers and verifiers have legal authority to issue or verify credentials.\n- Smart contracts will be audited for security before deployment.\n\n---\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"qqCAAI,SAAA;0CAEC,SAAA;aACL,SAAA;wCAEK,SAAA;;yCACD,SAAA,UAAU,CAAA,EAAA,wEAAA;yCACV,SAAA,SAAS,CAAA,EAAA,8DAAA;yCACT,SAAA,cAAc,CAAA,EAAA,2DAAA;yCACd,SAAA,iBAAiB,CAAA,EAAA,sFAAA;yCACjB,SAAA,sBAAsB,CAAA,EAAA,mDAAA;yCACtB,SAAA,YAAY,CAAA,EAAA,gDAAA;;2CAEX,SAAA;uFACH,SAAA,0BAAY,SAAA,4BAAc,SAAA,qHAExB,SAAA,0BAAY,SAAA,sFAAwE,SAAA,qHACpF,SAAA,4BAAc,SAAA,iEAAmD,SAAA,0GACjE,SAAA,oCAAsB,SAAA,8DAAgD,SAAA,0GACtE,SAAA,iCAAmB,SAAA,0DAA4C,SAAA;kCAE9D,SAAA;;cACH,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;mDAEG,SAAA;;cACH,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;"}
