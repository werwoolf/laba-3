### 2. Overall Description

#### 2.1 Product Perspective
The platform is a standalone application leveraging the Solana blockchain to manage educational and professional credentials securely. It eliminates reliance on centralized databases by storing credentials on a decentralized ledger, ensuring transparency and immutability. The system integrates with existing educational and certification systems, allowing issuers to publish credentials and verifiers to confirm their authenticity.

#### 2.2 Product Functions
- **Issuance**: Authorized issuers create and publish credentials on the blockchain.
- **Storage**: Credentials are stored immutably on the Solana blockchain.
- **Verification**: Verifiers query the blockchain to validate credentials.
- **User Management**: Registration and profile management for issuers, verifiers, and credential owners.
- **Search and Retrieval**: Credential owners can access their credentials.
- **Revocation**: Issuers can revoke credentials if necessary.

#### 2.3 User Characteristics
| User Role | Description | Technical Proficiency |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Issuers** | Educational institutions or certification bodies issuing credentials. | Moderate; requires training on platform features. |
| **Verifiers** | Employers or institutions verifying credentials. | Basic; familiar with web applications. |
| **Credential Owners** | Individuals who own diplomas or certificates. | Basic; familiar with online platforms. |
| **Administrators** | Manage user access and system operations. | Advanced; technical expertise required. |

#### 2.4 Constraints
- Development must use Rust, Solana, Anchor, Cargo test framework, React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS.
- The platform must operate on the Solana blockchain.
- Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) is mandatory.
- The system must support at least 1000 transactions per second.

#### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have internet access and modern web browsers.
- The Solana blockchain remains operational.
- Issuers and verifiers have legal authority to issue or verify credentials.
- Smart contracts will be audited for security before deployment.
