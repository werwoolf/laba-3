### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the requirements for developing a "Secure Blockchain Platform for Managing Diplomas and Certificates." The platform aims to provide a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for issuing, storing, and verifying educational and professional credentials using blockchain technology. This document serves as a blueprint for developers, stakeholders, and users to ensure the product meets its intended goals.

#### 1.2 Scope
The platform enables:
- Issuance of diplomas and certificates by authorized institutions.
- Secure, immutable storage of credentials on the Solana blockchain.
- Verification of credentials by employers or other authorized entities.
- User-friendly web interfaces for issuers, verifiers, and credential owners.
- Compliance with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR.

The system will be built using Rust, Solana, Anchor, and Cargo test framework for the backend, and React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. It will operate on the Solana blockchain to ensure high performance and scalability.
