Introduction\n\n#### 1.1 Purpose\nThis Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines the requirements for developing a \"Secure Blockchain Platform for Managing Diplomas and Certificates.\" The platform aims to provide a decentralized, secure, and transparent system for issuing, storing, and verifying educational and professional credentials using blockchain technology. This document serves as a blueprint for developers, stakeholders, and users to ensure the product meets its intended goals.\n\n#### 1.2 Scope\nThe platform enables:\n- Issuance of diplomas and certificates by authorized institutions.\n- Secure, immutable storage of credentials on the Solana blockchain.\n- Verification of credentials by employers or other authorized entities.\n- User-friendly web interfaces for issuers, verifiers, and credential owners.\n- Compliance with data privacy regulations, such as GDPR.\n\nThe system will be built using Rust, Solana, Anchor, and Cargo test framework for the backend, and React, React Query, and Tailwind CSS for the frontend. It will operate on the Solana blockchain to ensure high performance and scalability.\n\n#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n| Term | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| **Blockchain** | A distributed ledger technology ensuring immutability and transparency. |\n| **Diploma** | An official document awarded upon completion of an educational program. |\n| **Certificate** | A document attesting to a qualification or course completion. |\n| **Smart Contract** | Self-executing code on the blockchain enforcing agreement terms. |\n| **Solana** | A high-performance blockchain for decentralized applications. |\n| **Anchor** | A Rust framework for building Solana smart contracts. |\n| **Rust** | A programming language focused on safety and performance. |\n| **React** | A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. |\n| **React Query** | A library for managing server state in React applications. |\n| **Tailwind CSS** | A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. |\n\n#### 1.4 References\n- GeeksforGeeks: Software Requirement Specification (SRS) Format ([SRS Format](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-requirement-specification-srs-format/#functional-requirements)).\n- Habr: Technical Assignment ([Technical Assignment](https://habr.com/ru/articles/328822/)).\n- IEEE STD 830-1998: Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.\n- ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148-2011: Systems and Software Engineering â€” Requirements Engineering.\n\n#### 1.5 Overview\nThis SRS is divided into:\n- **Introduction**: Context, scope, and definitions.\n- **Overall Description**: High-level product overview and user characteristics.\n- **Specific Requirements**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.\n\n---\n"],"names":["_jsx","_components"],"mappings":"moCAAI,SAAA;8BAEC,SAAA;aACL,SAAA;4BAEK,SAAA;aACL,SAAA;;cACE,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;aAEF,SAAA;6DAEK,SAAA;uFACH,SAAA,qBAAO,SAAA,0GAEL,SAAA,6BAAe,SAAA,2IACf,SAAA,0BAAY,SAAA,2IACZ,SAAA,8BAAgB,SAAA,iIAChB,SAAA,iCAAmB,SAAA,oIACnB,SAAA,yBAAW,SAAA,iIACX,SAAA,yBAAW,SAAA,yHACX,SAAA,uBAAS,SAAA,6HACT,SAAA,wBAAU,SAAA,sHACV,SAAA,8BAAgB,SAAA,8HAChB,SAAA,+BAAiB,SAAA;iCAEhB,SAAA;;eACH,SAAA,CAAA,mEAAAA,MAAAC,EAAA,EAAA,6GAAiE,SAAA,YAAiH,CAAA,EAAA,IAAA;eAClL,SAAA,CAAA,+BAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,EAAA,6CAA6B,SAAA,sBAA2D,CAAA,EAAA,IAAA;cACxF,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;+BAEG,SAAA;aACL,SAAA;;yCACI,SAAA,cAAc,CAAA,EAAA,oCAAA;yCACd,SAAA,qBAAqB,CAAA,EAAA,yDAAA;yCACrB,SAAA,uBAAuB,CAAA,EAAA,wDAAA;;"}
